No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown; in fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program. One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk of actual trading. for example, the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points which can also adversely affect actual trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all which can adversely affect trading results.","videoId":"z2KKiSvUcr0","publishedAt":"2021-10-25T22:13:17Z","privacyStatus":"public","channelTitle":"Path Trading Partners","thumbnail":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z2KKiSvUcr0/maxresdefault.jpg","height":720,"width":1280}}},{"node":{"id":"d5c5ec36-43f3-51b1-844b-d96a2f350820","title":"Tesla - Gamma Squeeze to End all Gamma Squeezes? 10-25-21","description":"#TSLA #Tesla #Trading #Analysis #GammaSqueeze\n\n** BuyMeACoffee- https://www.buymeacoffee.com/pathtrading\n\n** Patreon - https://www.patreon.com/pathtradingpa...\n\n** TradingView - https://www.tradingview.com/gopro/?sh...\n\n** Twitter - http://www.twitter.com/Path_Trading\n\n-+-+-+-+\n\nGet caught up on our free YouTube ‘trading training’ videos\n\nHow I set up my Charts\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD5sH...\n\nEMA - 'Exponential Moving Average' : Crypto Technical Analysis\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R73qN...\n\nSMA - 'Simple Moving Average' Crypto Technical Analysis:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWSwn...\n\n -- 'Price Action Series' for Cryptos \n\nROTATION ZONE - Part 1 : Crypto Technical Analysis\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bW4Z...\n\nROTATION ZONE - Part 2 : Crypto Technical Analysis\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAx97...\n\nROTATION ZONE - Part 3 : Crypto Technical Analysis\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS5Oo...\n\nRisk Disclosure: Futures and forex trading contains substantial risk and is not for every investor.
