                    <h2>Support, Resistance, and Significant Levels</h2>
                    <p className="courses-text">Support and Resistance is great, but are you aware that not all levels are created equal? Many traders think of support and resistance as just a support line or a resistance line. They treat this line as an exact science and donâ€™t have a consistent way of drawing the lines or determining trades to take off of the support and resistance lines. In This course set, you will learn our concept of Significant Levels. A Significant Level is an area of the market to which price has had a strong emotional reaction, and is likely to have a strong reaction again. Learn to spot them, draw them and use them to trade and plce good, solid stop-loss orders.</p>
